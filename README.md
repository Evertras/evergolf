## What is this?

Mario Golf is fun. PGA Tour series is fun. But neither of them come remotely
close to resembling a round for a normal golfer, given ridiculous accuracy and
hilariously good putting abilities.

Instead, Evergolf aims to recreate the general golfer experience for two
purposes:

First, as an exercise in course management. Does it really make sense to hit a
driver on this hole? Should I go for it in 2? Should I go for the pin or aim
for the larger part of the green?

Second, as an exercise in targeting improvement. What could I do with a more
accurate driver? What if I added a hybrid? What if I improve my putting to
match that of a scratch golfer?

And finally, it's weirdly fun anyway. Or maybe that's just me.
