## What is this?

Mario Golf is fun. PGA Tour series is fun. But neither of them come remotely
close to resembling a round for a normal golfer, given ridiculous accuracy and
hilariously good putting abilities.

Instead, Evergolf aims to recreate the general golfer experience for two
purposes:

First, as an exercise in course management. Does it really make sense to hit a
driver on this hole? Should I go for it in 2? Should I go for the pin or aim
for the larger part of the green?

Second, as an exercise in targeting improvement. What could I do with a more
accurate driver? What if I added a hybrid? What if I improve my putting to
match that of a scratch golfer?

And finally, it's weirdly fun anyway. Or maybe that's just me.

Real stats are used when possible. The goal over time is to improve these to be
more and more accurate to actual stats when possible. The ability to select a
handicap for different portions of the game is coming, for now this is hardcoded
to be around a 15 handicap's abilities for short game and putting, and the long
shots are based on my own game in an effort to motivate myself to work on my
swing.

For more information see the [docs folder](./docs).

## What course is this?

[Chiba Shimin Golf (千葉市民ゴルフ)](https://chibashimin-golf.jp/courseguide/) -
a relatively simple, flat-ish 9 hole course.

I'd like to add more courses in the future, but for now this was enough work to
get in and I'd rather not mess with terrain elevations in 2d Google Earth views
for now.
