# Overview

Evergolf is a simulator for the rest of us. It isn't PGA Tour 2k3, or Mario
Golf. It's intended as a sandbox simulator to work on course management for
everyday golfers, and maybe even be fun on the side if you're the kind of person
that opens Google Earth to plan out your round like me.

In Evergolf, you can play a course by using a list of preset shots that match
your real game, with a real dispersion and expected misses. There's no power bar
or swing mechanic action, just a selection of the desired shot and what
direction you want to aim.

The point of Evergolf is to allow people to explore different course management
strategies. Is it really worth going for that par 5 in 2? Is that hero shot
actually going to pay off?

It also will highlight areas for improvement. What if you added a draw to your
arsenal? What if you could tighten up your short iron dispersion? How much
would that really help your game?

The rest of this document contains some high level overview/thoughts about where
to start, with some deeper details in other docs.

## Interface

For this initial version, the interface will be a simple web page with top down
views of a golf course. The player will be put on the tee and can select a shot
from a preset list they've created for their own game, and hit the ball.
